            <h2>Relevance to Contemporary Issues</h2>
            <p><em>Noli Me Tangere</em> remains significant today as it continues to mirror various socio-political realities. The issues that Rizal highlighted in his time—corruption, inequality, and the abuse of power—still resonate in contemporary society.</p>

            <h3>Systemic Oppression and Social Injustice</h3>
            <p>The plight of characters like Sisa, Basilio, and Crispin showcases the systemic injustices faced by the poor. Today, marginalized communities still struggle with poverty, labor exploitation, and lack of access to education and healthcare. Rizal’s work underscores the need for systemic change and social equity.</p>

            <h3>Corruption and the Abuse of Power</h3>
            <p>Rizal's portrayal of corrupt friars and government officials in the novel reflects the persistent problem of corruption in modern governance. Issues such as political dynasties, lack of accountability, and human rights violations continue to hinder national progress.</p>

            <h3>Freedom and Resistance</h3>
            <p>Just as Ibarra and Elias represented different approaches to reform and revolution, today’s social movements continue to advocate for justice and human rights. Around the world, people resist authoritarian rule, fight for press freedom, and challenge oppression—values that Rizal strongly believed in.</p>

            <h3>Education as a Tool for Empowerment</h3>
            <p>Rizal emphasized that education is the foundation of a progressive society. In modern times, access to quality education remains a crucial issue. Digital literacy, misinformation, and educational disparities are some of the challenges that must be addressed to achieve national development.</p>

            <h3>Encouraging Critical Thinking and Social Awareness</h3>
            <p>More than a literary masterpiece, <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> serves as a wake-up call for readers to analyze their society critically. It reminds us that passivity enables oppression and that awareness, coupled with action, is essential in creating meaningful change.</p>
