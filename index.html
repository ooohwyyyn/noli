        <p>José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda (<strong>1861–1896</strong>) was a Filipino nationalist, intellectual, physician, and writer, widely regarded as one of the most important figures in Philippine history. Born in Calamba, Laguna, he was a brilliant student, excelling in his studies at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and later at the University of Santo Tomas, where he studied medicine. Rizal furthered his education in Europe, earning degrees in ophthalmology and becoming proficient in several languages.</p>

        <p>Rizal is best known for his novels <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>, which criticized the Spanish colonial government and the abuses of the clergy. His works sparked the desire for reform and inspired many Filipinos to seek independence. Although Rizal advocated for peaceful reforms rather than violent revolution, he was arrested and executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896, after being falsely accused of supporting the revolutionary movement.</p>

        <p>Rizal’s martyrdom played a key role in inspiring the Philippine Revolution, and he is remembered as a national hero whose contributions to Filipino identity, freedom, and justice continue to resonate to this day.</p>

        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>During the Spanish colonial period, Filipino natives were subjected to oppressive laws, forced labor, and unjust taxation. The Spanish clergy held significant political and economic influence, often surpassing even the governor-general’s power. This backdrop of inequality fueled the rise of educated reformists like José Rizal, who sought to expose these injustices through literature.</p>
