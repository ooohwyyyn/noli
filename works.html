            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>During the 19th century, the Philippines was a colony of Spain for over 300 years. The Spanish government exercised absolute control over the islands, with the governor-general as the highest authority. However, the true power lay in the hands of the Spanish friars, who controlled vast lands, operated schools, and heavily influenced political and social affairs.</p>

            <p>Filipinos, especially the indios, were treated as second-class citizens. They faced forced labor (polo y servicios), unfair taxation, and limited access to education. Wealth and power remained in the hands of Spanish officials, the clergy, and the mestizos. The Guardia Civil, a military police force, frequently abused their authority, oppressing ordinary Filipinos.</p>

            <p>In response to these injustices, a group of educated Filipinos, known as the Ilustrados (the enlightened ones), emerged. These individuals, including José Rizal, had the privilege of studying abroad and were exposed to liberal ideas of equality and justice. Inspired by the suffering of his people, Rizal wrote <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> to awaken national consciousness and expose the corruption of the colonial system. His novel played a crucial role in inspiring the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule.</p>

            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
            <p><em>Noli Me Tangere</em> follows the story of Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young Filipino who returns to the Philippines after studying in Europe for seven years. Idealistic and hopeful, he dreams of bringing progress to his country through education.</p>

            <p>Upon his return, Ibarra learns that his father, Don Rafael Ibarra, was wrongly accused of heresy and subversion by the Spanish friars. His father died in prison under suspicious circumstances. Heartbroken but determined, Ibarra plans to build a school, believing that education is the key to progress.</p>

            <p>However, his efforts are opposed by Padre Dámaso, a powerful friar who despises the Ibarra family. With the help of corrupt officials, Dámaso orchestrates a plan to have Ibarra falsely accused of rebellion. Branded a traitor, Ibarra is forced to flee.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, his fiancée, María Clara, discovers that she is Padre Dámaso’s illegitimate daughter. Heartbroken and powerless, she chooses to enter a convent, believing it is her only escape from the friars’ control.</p>

            <p>Ibarra’s escape is aided by Elias, a mysterious figure who shares his desire for justice. Despite Elias’ efforts, Ibarra is declared an enemy of the state. He loses everything—his family, love, and dreams. The novel’s tragic ending reflects the harsh realities of Spanish colonial rule, serving as a wake-up call for Filipinos to fight for their rights.</p>
